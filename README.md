Hi there - I'm Jonathan. I'm Principal Java Architect at Microsoft. Before this I was a Cloud Developer Advocate for Java at Microsoft, and before that I was a technical lead in the Java team at Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp for nine years. I contribute to open source, most notably <a href="http://openjdk.org">OpenJDK</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-java">Azure SDK for Java</a>. I take immense pride in having my code deployed on almost every computer on the planet. I am passionate about creating excellent developer experiences with <a href="https://www.jonathangiles.net/java-api-design-best-practices.html">considered API design</a>, documentation, testing, and tooling. I have toured the world extensively to <a href="https://www.jonathangiles.net/presentations.html">present</a> and write on these topics, and as a result I am a Java Champion, JavaOne Rockstar, and a Dukeâ€™s Choice award-winner.

My professional bio is on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/jonathangiles">LinkedIn</a>. I tweet occasionally on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jonathangiles">Twitter</a>.
